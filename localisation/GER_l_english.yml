 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Born in 1859 into multiple of the most powerful families in the world, Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert Hohenzollern was groomed from birth to rule. All throughout his education, he rejected the teachings of English liberalism and constitutionalism, preferring nationalist autocracy openly and fervently. This reflected in his rule after 1888, when,following the death of his father and grandfather, he was crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Two years later, he made the controversial decision to dismiss legendary Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and took direct control of German politics, steering the nation on an aggressive “New Course.” Over the next decades, Germany was solidified as a world power, with greater investment in scientific, industrial, and military affairs. However, the Kaiser’s bellicose and reckless foreign policy brought the nation to the brink of war repeatedly, until it finally came in 1914. During the Great War, Germany suffered greatly and the popularity of the Kaiser plummeted. In the later years of the war, it seemed that Wilhelm might very well lose his crown, either to foreign invaders or an internal uprising. However, with victory in the east, the situation stabilized, and a peace was negotiated in 1920. Devastated but alive, the German nation and monarchy limped on for 16 more years. Political and economic crises such as the rise of the DAP and the Great Depression still hold Germany back, and Wilhelm’s spirits have never been lower nor his health worse. However, as he said at the outbreak of the war, "I know no parties anymore, only Germans!""
