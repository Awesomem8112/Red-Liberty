 kato_shidzue_desc:0 "A dark horse within the Nihon Ronoto, Kato is one of the most influential and powerful women in the world. The youngest and first ever female Prime Minister to take office, Kato was chosen due to her remarkably high popularity among women, who now have the ability to vote. It was this very ability which has given the Ronoto their victory, and Kato, a feminist inspired by the American Margaret Sanger, has leveraged this fact to assemble a cabinet of socialists and feminists, including several women, to enact her radically progressive plans. If she succeeds, the Ronoto may forever be the party of the Japanese woman."
 saito_takao_desc:0 "Saito Takao, one of the most prominent progressives in modern Japan, has been a rising star in the Minseito party for years. A staunch enemy of nationalist militarist Konoe, and occasional liaison with the leftist Ronoto party, it came as little surprise that Saito and his allies pushed for forming a coalition with the socialists after the 1936 elections. Although not a socialist himself, Saito is more than willing to work with them for social reform and opposition to militarism. Now that he himself is Prime Minister, with or without Ronoto allies, it is his turn to leave his mark on Japan."
 konoe_fumimaro_desc:0 "Fumimaro Konoe is one of the most powerful aristocrats in Japan, and the head of the Tohokai faction, an unofficial political bloc representing the military, aristocracy, and nationalists. Disillusioned with the Western concept of liberal democracy after the Great War, and horrified by the progressive, leftist, and populist vision gaining popularity in Japan, Konoe developed a vision of an authoritarian, nationalist state headed by the military and the Emperor. After the incredibly dangerous formation of the Minseito-Ronoto coalition that threatened to destroy Japan, Konoe rapidly organized the Tohokai and military into bringing down the government and putting himself into power. Now, Konoe’s radical vision is a national reality."
 showa_desc:0 "The Emperor of Japan and one of the most powerful men in the world, His Imperial Majesty is one of the supreme motivating forces in Japanese politics. Although not directly involved with most political affairs, his endorsement is needed for the survival of any government. With the dismissal of the last Diet and the next one still being elected, Showa is effectively the head of state."
 POLITICS_INUKAI_TSUYOSHI_DESC:0 "Inukai Tsuyoshi is very old; the oldest person to hold the office of Prime Minister by no small margin. This grants him much respect in Japanese culture and politics, but has also led to serious concerns about his health. Born into a samurai family and making his first impression as a reporter, Inukai has been involved in politics for more than fifty years. A staunch moderate and civic conservative operating a compromise cabinet of both Seiyukai and Minseito members, Inukai has maintained the stability (and civility) of Japanese politics for years through compromise and cooperation, despite pressure from the military and a growing leftist movement. Now in his eighties and rarely making public appearances, many wonder what whether Inukai will die or resign, and what will happen next."

 JAP_spiders_web_desc:0 "His Imperial Majesty has, in his divine wisdom, seen through the communist farce of Saito’s government and appointed Konoe Fumimaro to lead the national government. The first stage of his schemes is complete, but much more work remains to be done. Public support is low and the House of Representatives opposes us. It is time to secure our rule."
 JAP_send_troops:0 "Send in the Troops!"
 JAP_send_troops_desc:0 "The streets are filled with mass protest and rioting. We are witnessing the greatest outbreak of civil unrest in recent Japanese history and we must rapidly restore order. Civilian police and bureaucrats cannot be trusted, as they are filled with liberal and communist sympathizers. The only people we can trust to bring back order to the streets are our allies in the military."
 JAP_arrest_agitators:0 "Arrest Agitators"
 JAP_arrest_agitators_desc:0 "The protests and civil unrest are not blowing over like we’d hoped. Many of them are being sparked and attended by the same groups: communists, anarchists, student activists, and foreigners. We can use the Kempeitai, our military police, to track them down and arrest them. With these agitators in custody, hopefully the protests will die down."
 JAP_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
 JAP_martial_law_desc:0 "If we are to restore order to the streets, we must temporarily invoke martial law. Some may call this an overreach of government power, but the situation is dire. We will make the Diet see sense and approve this measure. Liberal politicians may not have the stomach to do what must be done, but the army does."
 JAP_national_unity:0 "National Unity"
 JAP_national_unity_desc:0 "Some would say that Konoe Fumimaro is a divisive figure. They could not be more wrong. Konoe is uniting the nation like no Prime Minister has before. "National Unity" could be considered the single goal of his government. If we can remind the people of this, maybe they will see that it is the communists and agitators who are truly dividing the nation."
 JAP_imperial_support:0 "Imperial Support"
 JAP_imperial_support_desc:0 "His Imperial Majesty appointed us to lead the government, but it is likely that even he, in his divine wisdom, could not have foreseen the amount of resistance we have had to face, or the extreme measures we have had to go to in order to deal with it. Soliciting a statement of Imperial support for our actions would go a long way towards securing our legitimacy."
 JAP_goverments_mandate:0 "The Government's Mandate"
 JAP_goverments_mandate_desc:0 "All the pieces are in place, and the unrest is beginning to die down. The military patrols the streets, suppressing our opponents and making sure our supporters’ voices are heard loudest. With the Emperor publicly supporting us, it is now socially unacceptable to oppose the government. The riots are over and discontent is fading. Now, we may turn our attention to our true goals..."
 
 japan.3.desc:0 "Chiyo knocked on the door a final time. Prime Minister Inukai had still not woken up, and a meeting of the Diet was to take place in only an hour. “For Inukai-sama to sleep in is normal,” Hideko, another servant, said, “but this is ridiculous!” Chiyo took a deep breath and braced herself for the act of disrespect she, only the head servant, was now forced to commit. She opened the door to Inukai’s room, stepped in, quickly bowed, and spoke. "My humblest apologies, Prime Minister, but it is nearly 10:00 in the morning..." Inukai did not respond in any way, simply lying still on the bed. Chiyo stood, frozen and still bowed, unsure of what to do next. She looked back at the doorway, where Hideko shrugged at her. Chiyo gradually rose, and slowly, near silently, approached the sleeping Prime Minister. She looked back at Hideko with widened eyes."
 japan.4.desc:0 "Thousands were present for the state-sponsored funeral of Inukai Tsuyoshi. His body had already been cremated, but speeches were given and a great procession of soldiers, politicians, aristocrats, and others was held in Tokyo. Even the Emperor himself was in attendance, although not publicly visible. Speeches were held, calling him a hero and the savior of Japanese politics. Although no one mentioned it explicitly, there was also a hanging uncertainty for what his passing would mean for Japanese politics. New elections were likely to be held, but what then?"
 japan.5.desc:0 "Several hundred Diet members slowly trickle out of the building, minds and mouths abuzz with plans for the future. The acting Prime Minister just read a decree from His Imperial Majesty disbanding the Diet. As his last act before he resigned, he called for new elections, a measure which passed unanimously. The Diet members now all plot their re-elections and create plans for the next government. Most of their districts are secure, but some, especially among the Seiyukai, are not. The next few months will see intense campaigning across Japan."
 japan.6.desc:0 "Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was the greatest prime minister in recent history! He saved the economy; families in Europe and America are starving, while our economy booms! He saved us from imperialism; he resisted Western pressure and brought our Asian brothers closer together! And lastly, he saved us from radicalism. Far-left radicals want to dismantle our economy and turn Japan into a Russo-American puppet. They want to defy nature and have women take on men’s responsibilities. The Ronoto fanatics would destroy the kokutai and the Minseito would let them! Proud citizens, the Seiyukai have made Japan great, and you must vote for them so that we may keep it that way."
 japan.7.desc:0 "The world is changing. Japan is doing well, but we must never stop improving! Prime Minister Inukai was a hero and a savior for giving Japan stability in our time of crisis. But the time of crisis is over, and Japan must move with the ever-changing times! The Seiyukai simply won’t let Japan change. The economy is strong, but stagnant. Cooperation with the private sector could make it grow! Our relations with the outside world are good, but a diplomat’s touch could make them stronger. Extremism has been curbed, but a moderate’s government could preserve stability. Whatever the Seiyukai give, the Minseito can give more of! Vote Minseito for a Japanese future."
 japan.8.desc:0 "Japan needs reform. The military is out of control as they murder our politicans. The government cares not for its citizens. The Seiyukai say the economy is booming, but who sees that wealth? Not common workers. Executives, do you not think your workers to be people? Men, do you not think your mothers and wives to deserve rights? Japanese, do you not think your Asian brothers are your equals? Our society is free for executives, democratic for men, and anti-imperialist for Japanese. The Seiyukai and Minseito work for the few, not the many! We must build a society that fights for all people, and only the Ronoto can get us there!"
 japan.9.desc:0 "The outcome of the election is over - in a shock to the conservative establishment who expected the late Prime Minister’s popularity to save them, the Seiyukai have lost seats in the Diet! Most of those seats have gone to the Minseito or the Ronoto, who could form a coalition if the Minseito want to. The Seiyukai, however, fully expect the newly empowered Minseito to return to the fold and form a new moderate government to continue Inukai’s legacy."
 japan.10.desc:0 "On Saito’s desk sat two letters. One from Ichiro, and one from Abe. The letters used vastly different rhetoric and had starkly different tones, but both requested the same thing in the end: “please form a coalition with us.” Both letters were compelling. Abe’s letter appealed to a long history of agreement and cooperation between Saito and the Ronoto party, and how the Seiyukai were unlikely to support his beloved social reforms. Ichiro’s letter appealed to Saito’s deep respect for Inukai, his love of Japan, and desire for stable, civil politics. Saito wanted to work with the Ronto and make true, ambitious changes, but he did not miss the implicit threat in Ichiro’s words. The right would view a progressive coalition as a threat to Japan, and may plunge the nation into turmoil. In the end, it was Saito’s turn to write a fateful letter."
 japan.11.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, head in hands. “We’re done, Abe-san. This has been a long time coming.” The sense of despair in the room was palpable. Weeks had passed and still not a single general nor admiral had agreed to serve as the Army or Navy Minister for the cabinet. This political strike looked as if it would bring down the government.\n\n"This has Konoe-san’s fingerprints all over it," Abe said. "We cannot fall. If we do, Konoe might take our place and institute a reactionary terror that would make Mussolini-shi hang his head in shame."\n\n"What you want us to do?" Saito said with a tinge of annoyance, raising his head to look at Abe. "Our government is done for if we cannot fill these cabinet seats, and the military have made their position on the issue quite clear."\n\n"What if we did not have to pick a general?" Abe asked musingly.\n\n"We do," Saito retorted. “It’s in the constitution.”\n\n"Don’t you feel it odd that the constitution gives the military so much power over politics? Almost by accident."\n"What are you getting at, Abe-san?"\n\n"Maybe we should change that.""
 japan.12.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the ongoing political crisis, we, representing the House of Representatives in the Imperial Diet, have respectively come to your Imperial Majesty  with a petition for action. As of the current text of the Meiji Constitution of 1889, the cabinet seats of Army and Navy Minister must be filled by an active general or admiral respectively. This provision has enabled the military to exert a concerning degree of influence in domestic politics, with which they can bring down any government. This de facto veto power over the Prime Minister and his cabinet should be reserved only for Your Imperial Majesty, and is undermining our national democracy. The military should not have the capability to overrule the will of the Japanese people, and by doing so now for political reasons, is infringing on the kokutai and Your Imperial Majesty’s political privileges. We therefore humbly and respectfully request for Your Imperial Majesty to issue a proposition to the Diet to remove the requirement for Army and Navy Ministers to be active generals or admirals.\n\nSincerely, the House of Representatives of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.13.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the failure of the government under Prime Minister Saito Takao to properly assemble a cabinet, it appears that the government has failed. A new Prime Minister must be chosen. It is the opinion of us, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet, that the recent political crisis and general instability calls for a new approach to domestic governance, which is more in line with the needs, rather than the whims, of the masses, and which is more respectful to the kokutai, the military, and Your Imperial Majesty. We therefore humbly and respectfully propose to you that Konoe Fumimaro be considered as a candidate for the Prime Minister.\n\nSincerely, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.14.desc:0 "Saito raised the glass, smelled it, and, with a skeptical glance towards a grinning Abe and bemused Kato, took a drink. His face immediately contorted, and Abe burst out laughing, while Kato suppressed chuckle. “I am not ever trying American liquor again, Abe-san,” Saito coughed out after swallowing his mouthful of whiskey. Abe then turned to Kato. “You want to try it?” Kato laughed and waved her hand. "No thank you." After a moment of silence, she added, "I could never have guessed when I joined the Ronoto ten years ago, that in ten years I would be celebrating across the table from the Prime Minister!" "Well, you certainly earned it!" laughed Abe. "Thanks to your efforts, the Ronoto is almost more popular than the Minseito among women." "And with our help,” Saito said “you may finally get them the vote!” Kato smiled warmly at him. “Still,” he said, turning to Abe, “you can’t let her take all the credit! If it weren’t for your idea of the Constitutional Amendment, we wouldn’t have had the chance!" Silence cut across the room as Abe slowly looked over to Kato. Her smile had already dissipated. She broke her brief glare at Abe and turned curtly to Saito."
 japan.15.desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro looked out across the crowd as he accepted his position as Prime Minister. He finished speaking his allegiance to the Emperor, unblinking and annunciated, as he had practiced it a hundred times. The crowd was silent. Konoe gazed blankly at them. He was not hurt by their lack of enthusiasm. Peasants did not need to be enthusiastic. They only needed to be led. His thinking was disrupted by the gunfire salute behind him. Only then did the people begin to applaud. The salute was unusual, as was the presence of so many soldiers. "Unnecessary," Konoe’s advisor had told him. "It will send the wrong message," he said. "It’s just for my safety," he had told him. "A leftist assassin could hide in the crowd." But the truth was, the soldiers and the gunfire would send exactly the right kind of message. The Emperor, in his divine wisdom, had placed Konoe here to restore order. That meant soldiers, gunfire, and fear. Konoe gave a short speech. He stressed that the opposition had failed, that liberalism had failed, and that the path forward was one of Japanese tradition, faith, the Emperor, and the kokutai. Lasting only a few couple minutes, it was so well-rehearsed that Konoe scarcely even thought the words as he said them. Then, he walked off stage calmly, stood still disinterestedly for a few photos, and headed towards the Diet building."
 japan.16.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, dejected. He’d just lost yet another political battle over a minor cabinet position. He could already hear the grumblings of the other party members. He heard a soft knock on his office door and looked up slowly, gaze still lingering to the side. "Come in..." "Saito-sama, I have bad news," said the nervous party official. "I know, a Seiyukai member will be Minister of Agriculture. There’s nothing I can do about it." "No, sir. I meant..." The secretary gulped. "T-they just did an internal poll, and… it looks like most of the party wants a new leader." Saito went white in the face, and ran his fingers through his hair. "No, no, no… we can’t afford to do this right now. Do they know what they’re doing?" The official stared back blankly. "They’re playing right into the Seiyukai’s hands, don’t you see! I bet someone was paid off to run that poll!" Saito’s face began to go from white to red as he stood up rapidly from his desk. "Um… yes, sir. Whatever you say," the official said, raising an eyebrow and writing something down on his clipboard. "With my leadership of the party in question and the clock ticking...""
 
 japan_flavor.1.desc:0 "Inukai Tsuyoshi wandered into the dining room of his noble home, barely awake and still straightening his tie. “Inukai-sama, you have a visitor waiting in the lobby,” a servant said to him. "Thank you, Chiyo-kun," Inukai yawned as he walked towards the door. He entered the lobby, still rubbing his eyes. "I am sorry to keep you waiting like this," he said. "In my old age I am often a late-" The visitor laughed.\n\n“It’s fine, father!” Inukai looked back and smiled wide.\n\n"Takeru! My son! What a pleasant surprise. How are you? How was your trip to China? And how are my grandchildren?"\n\n"They have grown so fast, father. Michiko is now old enough to have opinions on Chinese politics, it seems." They both laughed. "We all enjoyed the trip, and I brought back good news for you."\n\n"Please, do share,” Inukai said as he gestured Takeru into the main room. “Would you like some water?"\n\n"No thank you, I must return to my duties soon." Takeru declined. "But I met with the Chinese Emperor and his Japanese advisor while I was there and spoke to them about Pan-Asianism. There was also an envoy from Indochina present."\n\n"Oh? Did things go smoothly?"\n\n"Yes," Takeru said, smiling. "It went very well. The Emperor seemed quite receptive, and got along well with the Vietnamese representative. It seems like the beginning of good relations."\n\n"That is wonderful news!" Inukai exclaimed, patting his son on the back.\n\n"Also," Takeru said, taking an envelope out of his jacket. "The envoy instructed me to give this to you. It’s a message from his Emperor, Cuong De. I know you were close, so I did not open it." Inukai took the sealed envelope in his old, shaky hands and opened it, reading its contents. He smiled warmly, folded it back up, and held it to his chest."
 japan_flavor.2.desc:0 ""Saito-sama," the secretary said. "I have the report you asked for on the goings-on of the military. "Saito Takao looked up at the man from his desk, which was covered by a scattered mess of open books and papers. "Thank you. Did you find anything interesting?"\n\n"Only some budget anomalies, sir. Might indicate corruption, but there’s not enough evidence." "Damn," Saito said, shaking his head. He knew if he could get a bombshell to hurl at the military, he could guarantee to appear in the headlines again. "Did you follow up on the donations?" "Yes, sir. You were right about the generals. They all seem to have financial ties to the Prince."\n\n"Not surprising," Saito said, standing up and pacing behind his desk. "That snake has been scheming his rise to power for more than a decade now. Konoe would destroy Japan." The secretary looked on, amazed but not surprised at Saito’s bluntness. He nodded when Saito looked at him. "Thank you for the report. Keep looking at the military, please. I think that’s the key. Bring me anything you find." The secretary bowed and walked out. Saito returned to his seat and looked over the sheet of paper. He was looking for some kind of conspiracy. Everyone knew there was one, but if he could just crack the code, maybe he could finally get Inukai to see what a threat the military was. Abe, Abaye, Iwasa, Tojo, Oka, Sugita… nothing was lining up for him. But it had to be here somewhere. Saito knew a conspiracy when he saw one, and the Japanese right was full of them. He knew that the eyes of the party were upon him, that they all thought there were better things to spend time and resources on. But as he looked at the report longer, he could see some connections fall into place."
 japan_flavor.3.desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro glared up at his visitor. An empty bottle of sake and a few sticks of low-burning incense adorned the table. The visitor, Hideki Tojo, continued his winding talk. Konoe wasn’t listening. "Tojo-san, it is late into the evening. You have spoken for nearly half an hour and said nothing. What do you want?" Tojo was silent, seemingly taken aback by the blunt harshness of Konoe’s words. "Konoe-sama, we both want the same thing. We both know Japan is succumbing to western degeneracy and decadence. We must bring back the spirit of Bushido and Japanese culture. This… liberalism. It isn’t working." "You still haven’t said anything." Tojo straightened up and clenched his jaw. "The military should intervene." Konoe rolled his eyes. "Finally. You’re suggesting a coup?" Tojo nodded. "Well, that’s an impressively stupid idea. The military is unpopular, and Inukai is loved by the entire country. If we attempted a coup, the people would sooner accept a state without an army than an army with a state." Tojo glared at Konoe indignantly. "Konoe-sama, I thought you wanted a true Japanese empire, but you’re willing to bow to the will of the people? The people be damned!" he said, slamming his hand on the table. "The Kokutai must be defended!" "I agree," said Konoe flatly. "But political reality is what it is. If you are really willing to risk a trial for treason in suggesting a coup now, you are a fool, Hideki.” Konoe stared coldly into Tojo’s eyes. “You, Hideki, are a military man, and there is a reason the military pays me to do your politics for you. We will strike not when democracy is strong, but when it is weak, and we will not strike with bullets, but with fear. And we will win, because liberals cannot fight fear. Only we, who have strong Bushido spirit can. You wrote that yourself.""
 japan_flavor.4.desc:0 "Ichiro Hatoyama sat at his desk. It was late, and he had meant to go home an hour ago. However, the work had a tendency to give way to more work, and Ichiro was loath to stop when he was in the middle of something. Only when the rabbit-hole of work had finally ended, and everyone else at the party headquarters had gone home, would Ichiro finally retire for the day. Paper after paper was read, signed, categorized, filled out, or written. As the sun dipped below the horizon and Inukai turned the lamp on his desk on, only a few papers remained. No one else in this office could clear a whole desk’s worth of work in a day. Ichiro pulled a great share of the weight in the Seiyukai, and he knew it. His name rarely graced the papers, and few in the public had heard of him, but the Prime Minister had. Inukai relied on Ichiro a great deal to keep the government functioning, and if not for him, his legendary Prime Ministership likely would have ended years ago. Ichiro was the silent workhorse of the Inukai administration not just because of his fast reading and organizational skills, but also for his discretion. As Inukai signed the second to last paper on his desk, he held up the last. He blinked as he read it, face still but heart racing. It was a report. A damning report. Evidence of corruption, bribes, conspiracy, and collaboration within the Seiyukai and between the Seiyukai, Tohokai, and the military. If this leaked to the press, the Inukai administration was over. Previous governments had been brought down by much, much less. Attached to the back of the report by a paperclip was a note from a fresh-faced party recruit he had met two days ago. The note said he had found this report while sorting papers, and didn’t know what it meant, but that he felt Ichiro should look at it. He breathed a sigh of relief. Then he stood up, walked to the wastebasket, and tore the report apart, letting the shredded pieces of paper drift down like cherry blossoms."
 japan_flavor.5.desc:0 ""-and that is why, all things considered, I think we should be adding women’s suffrage to our party platform," Kato Shidzue said, having spoken at length for several minutes. She looked over at Abe Isoo, the only other person in the Diet’s break room. He was reading a newspaper, nodding slowly. "Abe-san? Are you listening?" Abe looked up, meeting her gaze with his good eye. "Oh, um… yes, of course." Kato rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. "Comrade, this is important! What in the newspaper is more important than our party platform?" "Oh, well..." Abe started, pointing out a section of the paper, "Japan had its first professional baseball game today! And we helped sponsor it!" Kato looked at him silently. Abe set the newspaper aside. "I’m sorry, Kato-san. I was very inconsiderate. Please tell me what you were saying." "I’ve spoken with several diet members and several women’s campaigning groups over the past few months. Women’s suffrage is gaining popularity and becoming a wedge issue with the growth of the feminist movement you and I have fostered." Kato maintained eye contact with Abe to make sure he was still listening. He was. "I estimate that we could gain up to 5 or 10 more seats in the Diet than we would otherwise if we officially added women’s suffrage to our party platform. It would be a major step forward towards normalizing feminism and growing our base of support." Abe nodded his head, considering this. "Do you think it would alienate many men?" Kato grimaced slightly. "It’s possible, but I think it’s a risk we should take. The speech you gave last month did a lot to dispel the idea that feminism makes you less of a man, however. I think the biggest downside will be that we look more radical to the conservatives." "Not always a bad thing," Abe mused. Kato nodded in agreement. "I think you’re right," Abe said. “Women’s suffrage would probably be a good addition this year. And, even if it doesn’t go as well as we hope..."
