 inukai_ded:0 "Inukai has died"
 
 japan.3.desc:0 "Chiyo knocked on the door a final time. Prime Minister Inukai had still not woken up, and a meeting of the Diet was to take place in only an hour. “For Inukai-sama to sleep in is normal,” Hideko, another servant, said, “but this is ridiculous!” Chiyo took a deep breath and braced herself for the act of disrespect she, only the head servant, was now forced to commit. She opened the door to Inukai’s room, stepped in, quickly bowed, and spoke. "My humblest apologies, Prime Minister, but it is nearly 10:00 in the morning..." Inukai did not respond in any way, simply lying still on the bed. Chiyo stood, frozen and still bowed, unsure of what to do next. She looked back at the doorway, where Hideko shrugged at her. Chiyo gradually rose, and slowly, near silently, approached the sleeping Prime Minister. She looked back at Hideko with widened eyes."
 japan.4.desc:0 "Thousands were present for the state-sponsored funeral of Inukai Tsuyoshi. His body had already been cremated, but speeches were given and a great procession of soldiers, politicians, aristocrats, and others was held in Tokyo. Even the Emperor himself was in attendance, although not publicly visible. Speeches were held, calling him a hero and the savior of Japanese politics. Although no one mentioned it explicitly, there was also a hanging uncertainty for what his passing would mean for Japanese politics. New elections were likely to be held, but what then?"
 japan.5.desc:0 "Several hundred Diet members slowly trickle out of the building, minds and mouths abuzz with plans for the future. The acting Prime Minister just read a decree from His Imperial Majesty disbanding the Diet. As his last act before he resigned, he called for new elections, a measure which passed unanimously. The Diet members now all plot their re-elections and create plans for the next government. Most of their districts are secure, but some, especially among the Seiyukai, are not. The next few months will see intense campaigning across Japan."
 japan.6.desc:0 "Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was the greatest prime minister in recent history! He saved the economy; families in Europe and America are starving, while our economy booms! He saved us from imperialism; he resisted Western pressure and brought our Asian brothers closer together! And lastly, he saved us from radicalism. Far-left radicals want to dismantle our economy and turn Japan into a Russo-American puppet. They want to defy nature and have women take on men’s responsibilities. The Ronoto fanatics would destroy the kokutai and the Minseito would let them! Proud citizens, the Seiyukai have made Japan great, and you must vote for them so that we may keep it that way."
 japan.7.desc:0 "The world is changing. Japan is doing well, but we must never stop improving! Prime Minister Inukai was a hero and a savior for giving Japan stability in our time of crisis. But the time of crisis is over, and Japan must move with the ever-changing times! The Seiyukai simply won’t let Japan change. The economy is strong, but stagnant. Cooperation with the private sector could make it grow! Our relations with the outside world are good, but a diplomat’s touch could make them stronger. Extremism has been curbed, but a moderate’s government could preserve stability. Whatever the Seiyukai give, the Minseito can give more of! Vote Minseito for a Japanese future."
 japan.8.desc:0 "Japan needs reform. The military is out of control as they murder our politicans. The government cares not for its citizens. The Seiyukai say the economy is booming, but who sees that wealth? Not common workers. Executives, do you not think your workers to be people? Men, do you not think your mothers and wives to deserve rights? Japanese, do you not think your Asian brothers are your equals? Our society is free for executives, democratic for men, and anti-imperialist for Japanese. The Seiyukai and Minseito work for the few, not the many! We must build a society that fights for all people, and only the Ronoto can get us there!"
 japan.9.desc:0 "The outcome of the election is over - in a shock to the conservative establishment who expected the late Prime Minister’s popularity to save them, the Seiyukai have lost seats in the Diet! Most of those seats have gone to the Minseito or the Ronoto, who could form a coalition if the Minseito want to. The Seiyukai, however, fully expect the newly empowered Minseito to return to the fold and form a new moderate government to continue Inukai’s legacy."
 japan.10.desc:0 "On Saito’s desk sat two letters. One from Ichiro, and one from Abe. The letters used vastly different rhetoric and had starkly different tones, but both requested the same thing in the end: “please form a coalition with us.” Both letters were compelling. Abe’s letter appealed to a long history of agreement and cooperation between Saito and the Ronoto party, and how the Seiyukai were unlikely to support his beloved social reforms. Ichiro’s letter appealed to Saito’s deep respect for Inukai, his love of Japan, and desire for stable, civil politics. Saito wanted to work with the Ronto and make true, ambitious changes, but he did not miss the implicit threat in Ichiro’s words. The right would view a progressive coalition as a threat to Japan, and may plunge the nation into turmoil. In the end, it was Saito’s turn to write a fateful letter."
 japan.11.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, head in hands. “We’re done, Abe-san. This has been a long time coming.” The sense of despair in the room was palpable. Weeks had passed and still not a single general nor admiral had agreed to serve as the Army or Navy Minister for the cabinet. This political strike looked as if it would bring down the government.\n"This has Konoe-san’s fingerprints all over it," Abe said. "We cannot fall. If we do, Konoe might take our place and institute a reactionary terror that would make Mussolini-shi hang his head in shame."\n"What you want us to do?" Saito said with a tinge of annoyance, raising his head to look at Abe. "Our government is done for if we cannot fill these cabinet seats, and the military have made their position on the issue quite clear."\n"What if we did not have to pick a general?" Abe asked musingly.\n"We do," Saito retorted. “It’s in the constitution.”\n"Don’t you feel it odd that the constitution gives the military so much power over politics? Almost by accident."\n"What are you getting at, Abe-san?"\n"Maybe we should change that.""
 Japan.12.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the ongoing political crisis, we, representing the House of Representatives in the Imperial Diet, have respectively come to your Imperial Majesty  with a petition for action. As of the current text of the Meiji Constitution of 1889, the cabinet seats of Army and Navy Minister must be filled by an active general or admiral respectively. This provision has enabled the military to exert a concerning degree of influence in domestic politics, with which they can bring down any government. This de facto veto power over the Prime Minister and his cabinet should be reserved only for Your Imperial Majesty, and is undermining our national democracy. The military should not have the capability to overrule the will of the Japanese people, and by doing so now for political reasons, is infringing on the kokutai and Your Imperial Majesty’s political privileges. We therefore humbly and respectfully request for Your Imperial Majesty to issue a proposition to the Diet to remove the requirement for Army and Navy Ministers to be active generals or admirals.\n\nSincerely, the House of Representatives of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.13.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the failure of the government under Prime Minister Saito Takao to properly assemble a cabinet, it appears that the government has failed. A new Prime Minister must be chosen. It is the opinion of us, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet, that the recent political crisis and general instability calls for a new approach to domestic governance, which is more in line with the needs, rather than the whims, of the masses, and which is more respectful to the kokutai, the military, and Your Imperial Majesty. We therefore humbly and respectfully propose to you that Konoe Fumimaro be considered as a candidate for the Prime Minister.\n\nSincerely, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.14.desc:0 "Saito raised the glass, smelled it, and, with a skeptical glance towards a grinning Abe and bemused Kato, took a drink. His face immediately contorted, and Abe burst out laughing, while Kato suppressed chuckle. “I am not ever trying American liquor again, Abe-san,” Saito coughed out after swallowing his mouthful of whiskey. Abe then turned to Kato. “You want to try it?” Kato laughed and waved her hand. "No thank you." After a moment of silence, she added, "I could never have guessed when I joined the Ronoto ten years ago, that in ten years I would be celebrating across the table from the Prime Minister!" "Well, you certainly earned it!" laughed Abe. "Thanks to your efforts, the Ronoto is almost more popular than the Minseito among women." "And with our help,” Saito said “you may finally get them the vote!” Kato smiled warmly at him. “Still,” he said, turning to Abe, “you can’t let her take all the credit! If it weren’t for your idea of the Constitutional Amendment, we wouldn’t have had the chance!" Silence cut across the room as Abe slowly looked over to Kato. Her smile had already dissipated. She broke her brief glare at Abe and turned curtly to Saito."
 japan.15.desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro looked out across the crowd as he accepted his position as Prime Minister. He finished speaking his allegiance to the Emperor, unblinking and annunciated, as he had practiced it a hundred times. The crowd was silent. Konoe gazed blankly at them. He was not hurt by their lack of enthusiasm. Peasants did not need to be enthusiastic. They only needed to be led. His thinking was disrupted by the gunfire salute behind him. Only then did the people begin to applaud. The salute was unusual, as was the presence of so many soldiers. "Unnecessary," Konoe’s advisor had told him. "It will send the wrong message," he said. "It’s just for my safety," he had told him. "A leftist assassin could hide in the crowd." But the truth was, the soldiers and the gunfire would send exactly the right kind of message. The Emperor, in his divine wisdom, had placed Konoe here to restore order. That meant soldiers, gunfire, and fear. Konoe gave a short speech. He stressed that the opposition had failed, that liberalism had failed, and that the path forward was one of Japanese tradition, faith, the Emperor, and the kokutai. Lasting only a few couple minutes, it was so well-rehearsed that Konoe scarcely even thought the words as he said them. Then, he walked off stage calmly, stood still disinterestedly for a few photos, and headed towards the Diet building."
 japan.16.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, dejected. He’d just lost yet another political battle over a minor cabinet position. He could already hear the grumblings of the other party members. He heard a soft knock on his office door and looked up slowly, gaze still lingering to the side. "Come in..." "Saito-sama, I have bad news," said the nervous party official. "I know, a Seiyukai member will be Minister of Agriculture. There’s nothing I can do about it." "No, sir. I meant..." The secretary gulped. "T-they just did an internal poll, and… it looks like most of the party wants a new leader." Saito went white in the face, and ran his fingers through his hair. "No, no, no… we can’t afford to do this right now. Do they know what they’re doing?" The official stared back blankly. "They’re playing right into the Seiyukai’s hands, don’t you see! I bet someone was paid off to run that poll!" Saito’s face began to go from white to red as he stood up rapidly from his desk. "Um… yes, sir. Whatever you say," the official said, raising an eyebrow and writing something down on his clipboard. "With my leadership of the party in question and the clock ticking...""
