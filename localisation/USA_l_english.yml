 POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "A Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister, Norman Thomas made his first impression in politics with his pacifist, anti-war activism during the Great War, a position that drew him to the Socialist Party of America, who had delivered on their promises to keep America out of it. He gained popularity as an SPA journalist and was elected governor of New York in 1924. When Eugene V. Debs died in 1926, Thomas became the new head of the party as its leading non-immigrant member. He lost his first bid for president to Herbert Hoover in 1928, but after the Stock Market crash in 1929, Hoover’s popularity plummeted, and in 1932 President Norman Thomas and the SPA won the Presidency in a landslide. For all of his term, Norman Thomas has set about fixing the Great Depression with large amounts of government spending, public works projects, bureaucratic expansion, and worker-led recovery efforts. His recovery policies have been hindered and watered down by political resistance from the center and right wing, but where they have been enacted, have been both successful and popular."

 USA_red_liberty_desc:0 "After the election of President Eugene V. Debs in 1912, the Socialist Party of America became (and has remained) a major player in US politics. Though they have not been able to fully implement their agenda due to liberal and right-wing resistance, America has been changed by their radical pro-worker policies. Radical left-wing ideas are popular and normalized, which has in turn fostered greater radicalism on the right."

While it took time for the effects to be felt by the workers, when reality hit, it hit hard. Massive levels of unemployment, currency deflation, and the bank collapses that erased the life savings of millions all caused economic damage unprecedented in history. Tens of millions live in poverty, and many feel they have woken up from the American Dream."

 USA_pacifism_desc:0 "One of the most popular campaign promises of Eugene Debs was to keep America out of conflict. This promise he absolutely delivered on. The USA stayed out of the Great War, and hasn’t seen any real military conflict in decades. The military’s numbers and funding are low, and jingoism is not an ideal many Americans live by. Most Americans are glad that the country is at peace, and desire for it to stay that way."

 ### Campaign events from intro tree ###
 united_states.3.desc:0 "President Thomas walked up on stage. He looked over the crowd and hesitated. It seemed to be one of the largest crowds he had ever spoken to, easily numbering in the thousands. He began to sweat. He had always been an author first, not a public speaker. Still, these were mostly striking workers and SPA voters. It should go smoothly, he thought.\n\n"Good afternoon, Flint, Michigan!" Thomas said cheerfully into the microphone. The crowd roared. "I hear you boys have done a mighty fine job of organizing. Been on strike for 3 weeks? Good on you, men. Good on you." He chuckled slightly. "I read an interview in the paper last week with Alfred Sloan, the big boss here at GM." He gave the crowd time to jeer at his name. "He seemed awfully nervous about the strike. I think you all have got him on the run!" The crowd cheered and hollered more, waving their signs.\n\nOn them were written all sorts of slogans, quotes from Marx, and insults at Mr. Sloan and local management. Large banners colored black and red with SPA and IWW symbols emblazoned on them. As President Thomas looked over the cheering crowd, full of workers with both their fists and voices raised, he was proud. This is what he wanted America to look like. Thousands of working people, united in their knowledge of their own interests and needs. As he drifted off into thought, he realized that he had been silent for some time and the cheering was dying down.\n\n"You know, Alfred Sloan mentioned me in that interview with the Times," Thomas said, forming a sly smile. "He said, 'all this anarchist worker agitation is the fault of these socialists in office.'" The crowd began to boo. "Now wait, folks," the President spoke over them. "He gave me the best compliment I’ve received in all my time in office. He said, 'Because of the labor laws put forward by that communist Norman Thomas, my hands are tied and I can’t do anything to stop this strike.'" The President laughed. "And if that isn’t a reason to be proud of what we in the SPA have achieved, nothing is!"\n\nThe crowd went wild, cheering so loudly that Thomas almost felt pushed back by their sheer volume, and as he looked over the faces of all the uncountable number of striking workers, he knew that Alfred Sloan was right to be afraid, because these workers were the finest that American labor had to offer. As he looked on with pride, a chant was picked up in the crowd, and Thomas wiped a joyful tear from his eye."
 united_states.4.desc:0 "The President looked across the camp. The people watching him were thin as twigs and seemed to lack all spirit. The way Labor Secretary Perkins explained it to him did not show the reality of the situation at all. She said that in California there was a surplus of migrant workers and a shortage of jobs, so wages were low and conditions were bad. Her briefing did not prepare Thomas to see the absolute destitution and misery that this migrant work camp displayed. Dozens of eyes were upon him as he stood in front of a small crowd.\n\n"So, where are you all from?" Thomas asked, forcing an awkward smile.\n\n"We’re from Oklahoma," said one woman in the crowd. "We came here for work, and there ain’t none."\n\nThomas was taken aback by the bluntness of her words. No one had spoken to him like that before. "Well, there’s a government camp just a few miles north of here that’s a part of the Recovery Acts. They can give you work and see to your needs if you wish."\n\n"That’s where I came from!" yelled a man from the back of the crowd. "They ain’t got the money to pay us or food to feed us! It looks just like here, except the coppers harass ya when you try to get in!"\n\nThomas looked on in shock. "The police are opposing the Recovery?" he asked incredulously. A few people in the crowd laughed at his disbelief.\n\n"‘Course they are," said a teenage boy. "All the coppers ‘round here are crooked. The planters pay ‘em more than the state does. All they do is harass us, and wave guns at anyone who tries to organize."\n\n"Just two days back, they shot my brother for strikin’!" a young girl cried. "Killed him dead!"\n\nThomas looked to one of his aides. "It’s much worse here than I thought. We should go." He gave a brief farewell to the crowd and turned to walk away. As he did, however, a woman pushed his way past his bodyguards and grabbed him by the arm.\n\n"Mister President, sir," she pleaded to him. "It’s so much worse here than it looks. I’ve fed grown men here with my own breast milk because they’d starve to death otherwise. We want a recovery, sir, so, so badly, but we ain’t getting one here." She let go of his arm as tears began to flow from her eyes. Norman opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. After a few moments, she turned and walked back to the crowd."
 united_states.7.desc:0 "President Thomas wiped the sweat off the top of his head. His underarms were also stained with it, as he baked in the Louisiana sun. It didn’t seem to be phasing Senator Huey Long at all though, who was still giving a lively diatribe. "I know President Thomas wants to help the common people, he really does, and I admire that. But how much has his red Recovery really done for them? Something, sure, but not enough! Certainly nowhere near as much as my Share Our Wealth plan would!" The crowd murmured in agreement.\n\nThomas cut in. "I like your Share Our Wealth program, I really do! I wish my Recovery plan could look more like it," he said. The crowd looked with curiosity. "In fact, maybe it could, if Huey Long and his fellow AFP members would support it so that we didn’t have to compromise with the Republicans and Democrats for votes!" The crowd had been captured. Thomas had always been a more talented author than public speaker, but he had a chance here. He could make them cheer. He turned to Long. "But how is it that you think you can collectivize the capital of a society without collectivizing the means by which that capital is produced?" The crowd was silent. Titled heads and raised eyebrows were all that met his gaze. He lost it.\n\nLong pounced. "Now what in blazes is that supposed to mean? You’re talkin’ about socialism? Now there’s a good reason we don’t do socialism." Long smiled and spoke more loudly to the crowd. "Cause socialism destroys nations! We’ve seen what socialism did to Russia, and it’s a good thing that America remains a democracy or they’d do the same thing here! Our opposition is the only thing saving America from a red terror!" The crowd roared and cheered.\n\nLong softened his tone. "Capitalism isn’t just an economic system, folks. It’s a God-given mandate for the American people that dates all the way back to the Israelites and the Ten Commandments. 'Thou shalt not covet.' These reds, folks, they covet everything. Under socialism, you wouldn’t even get to own your own garters." The crowd nodded in agreement. President Thomas knew he couldn’t compete with Long’s oratories ability, even though Long was talking nonsense. He tried to draw on his religious education as he moved into a half-hearted and poorly received rebuttal."
