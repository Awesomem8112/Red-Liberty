 redliberty.1.desc:0 "”McKinley Narrowly Evades Assassination Attempt!”, was the all the craze back in 1901, when an Anarchist by the name of Leon Czolgosz, was quickly apprehended when an eagled eyed Secret Service bodyguard spotted the gun in Czolgosz’s sleeve. After an average Second Term of McKinley with no Social Reforms, the masses soon turned to the Progressive “Golden Boy” of the Democrats, William Randolph Hearst, however after a corruption scandal between Hearst’s “Investigation” on Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, a impeachment hearing was called on Hearst, revealing bribes and Yellow Journalism was apart of him, and so Hearst was impeached as President for Corruption. Former Vice-President, now President Henry Davis pardoned Hearst, however that Pardon wasn’t popular with the masses at all, as they demanded Hearst would be put in Prison for his corruption. The Masses turned to another third party for the upcoming 1909 elections, the Socialist Party USA, after Capitalism and Progressivism failed them, and so in the closest elections in American History, one vote away from being not elected, renowned pacifist Eugene V. Debs from the Socialist Party becomes the 28th President of the United States, and so he started his reforms to start to turn the Capitalist run Democracy into a Socialist one."

 us_election.2.d:0 "The president-elect stood before a massive, cheering crowd on the Washington Mall. His hands rested easily on the podium; this is, after all, his second time up here. “Ladies and gentlemen!” He announces into the microphone, silencing the rapturous applause that had heralded his ascent.\n \n“I stand before you today humbled and grateful. Humbled by the many millions that have pledged their support to me, and to the Socialist Party and all of its candidates. And I am grateful for the providence of our Lord, who has shown me the way here.”\n \n He paused for a moment, letting the cacophonous applause wash over him and up the steps of the Capitol. He didn’t turn around, but he smiled at the thought of the legislators behind him hearing the thunderous approval from the crowd. It would cow them; send them a message that the socialists were here to stay, and beloved by the people.\n \n His eyes wandered over the assembled masses. Some were holding flags and banners; mostly for the Socialist Party, but there were a few from the Socialist Labor Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, the Progressive Party, and Communist Party. He tacitly disapproved of the final one but had avoided disavowing them while on the campaign trail. If they would support him, then he would let them, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to give them anything for it.\n \n The unions were out in force too. The American Federation of Labor was, of course, present, as was the redoubtable Industrial Workers of the World, with their red and black banners, and there was even a single banner for the infirm and aging Knights of Labor.\n \n Parties and unions; they’d all been fighting decades for this, for a time when one of their own could sit in the White House. Debs had been a monumental victory, as had his reelection. But Thomas was a victory too. He was a statement, the socialists would not burn hot and short but were here to stay.\n \n A smile spread across Thomas’s face, and he continued his speech."
