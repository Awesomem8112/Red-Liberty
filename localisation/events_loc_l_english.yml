 redliberty.1.desc:0 "”McKinley Narrowly Evades Assassination Attempt!”, was the all the craze back in 1901, when an Anarchist by the name of Leon Czolgosz, was quickly apprehended when an eagled eyed Secret Service bodyguard spotted the gun in Czolgosz’s sleeve. After an average Second Term of McKinley with no Social Reforms, the masses soon turned to the Progressive “Golden Boy” of the Democrats, William Randolph Hearst, however after a corruption scandal between Hearst’s “Investigation” on Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, a impeachment hearing was called on Hearst, revealing bribes and Yellow Journalism was apart of him, and so Hearst was impeached as President for Corruption. Former Vice-President, now President Henry Davis pardoned Hearst, however that Pardon wasn’t popular with the masses at all, as they demanded Hearst would be put in Prison for his corruption. The Masses turned to another third party for the upcoming 1909 elections, the Socialist Party USA, after Capitalism and Progressivism failed them, and so in the closest elections in American History, one vote away from being not elected, renowned pacifist Eugene V. Debs from the Socialist Party becomes the 28th President of the United States, and so he started his reforms to start to turn the Capitalist run Democracy into a Socialist one."
