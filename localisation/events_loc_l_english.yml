 redliberty.1.desc:0 "”McKinley Narrowly Evades Assassination Attempt!”, was the all the craze back in 1901, when an Anarchist by the name of Leon Czolgosz, was quickly apprehended when an eagled eyed Secret Service bodyguard spotted the gun in Czolgosz’s sleeve. After an average Second Term of McKinley with no Social Reforms, the masses soon turned to the Progressive “Golden Boy” of the Democrats, William Randolph Hearst, however after a corruption scandal between Hearst’s “Investigation” on Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, a impeachment hearing was called on Hearst, revealing bribes and Yellow Journalism was apart of him, and so Hearst was impeached as President for Corruption. Former Vice-President, now President Henry Davis pardoned Hearst, however that Pardon wasn’t popular with the masses at all, as they demanded Hearst would be put in Prison for his corruption. The Masses turned to another third party for the upcoming 1909 elections, the Socialist Party USA, after Capitalism and Progressivism failed them, and so in the closest elections in American History, one vote away from being not elected, renowned pacifist Eugene V. Debs from the Socialist Party becomes the 28th President of the United States, and so he started his reforms to start to turn the Capitalist run Democracy into a Socialist one."
 redliberty.2.t:0 "The inauguration of Norman Thomas" 
 redliberty.2.d:0 "The president-elect stood before a massive, cheering crowd on the Washington Mall. His hands rested easily on the podium; this is, after all, his second time up here. “Ladies and gentlemen!” He announces into the microphone, silencing the rapturous applause that had heralded his ascent.\n \n“I stand before you today humbled and grateful. Humbled by the many millions that have pledged their support to me, and to the Socialist Party and all of its candidates. And I am grateful for the providence of our Lord, who has shown me the way here.”\n \n He paused for a moment, letting the cacophonous applause wash over him and up the steps of the Capitol. He didn’t turn around, but he smiled at the thought of the legislators behind him hearing the thunderous approval from the crowd. It would cow them; send them a message that the socialists were here to stay, and beloved by the people.\n \n His eyes wandered over the assembled masses. Some were holding flags and banners; mostly for the Socialist Party, but there were a few from the Socialist Labor Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, the Progressive Party, and Communist Party. He tacitly disapproved of the final one but had avoided disavowing them while on the campaign trail. If they would support him, then he would let them, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to give them anything for it.\n \n The unions were out in force too. The American Federation of Labor was, of course, present, as was the redoubtable Industrial Workers of the World, with their red and black banners, and there was even a single banner for the infirm and aging Knights of Labor.\n \n Parties and unions; they’d all been fighting decades for this, for a time when one of their own could sit in the White House. Debs had been a monumental victory, as had his reelection. But Thomas was a victory too. He was a statement, the socialists would not burn hot and short but were here to stay.\n \n A smile spread across Thomas’s face, and he continued his speech." 
 redliberty.5.t:0 "The Inevitable Compromise" 
 redliberty.5.d:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments. \n \n The election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had. \n \n Thomas sighed, leaning back in his chair and rubbing the bridge of his nose in frustration. They needed popular support to make changes, and to get popular support they needed to change things. A snake eating its own tail. A cycle that couldn’t be broken, and would probably doom the party unless they could. Talking about change was all well and good, but real change would be needed if they were to retain the position the people had voted them into. \n \n So, the goal was simple, get more voters. Widen the party’s appeal. He looked down at the paper again. Perhaps just a few small tweaks here and there to the party’s platform. Nothing major, of course. Socialism as an end goal wasn’t going anywhere. But a splash of populism would do them some good with the less radical voters. Reaching for his pen, he scrawled two more names in the margins of the page Henry Wallace and Wendell Willkie. One Democrat, one Republican, both agreeable."
 redliberty.4.t:0 "A Socialist Cabint it will be!" 
 redliberty.4.d:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments. \n \n The election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had. \n \n Thomas stared down at the list and smiled. It was a grand who’s who of socialist mainstays, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Emma Goldman. \n \n It was a radical list, to be sure. A more radical government had never been assembled since Lincoln’s day. But these were radical times, and it wouldn’t do to stick with stodgy liberal-capitalist political thinking. That was a dying breed, and Thomas had no wish to resuscitate it. \n \n The cabinet he was putting together would be unconventional, and Goldman’s inclusion would definitely raise some eyebrows, but it would show the people that, without a doubt, the Socialist Party was committed to socialism and the liberation of all men and women. \n \n That was the only real way to gain popular support, Thomas decided, leaning back in his chair with a smile on his face. Appeal to the people directly, and show them that the Socialist Party had their interests at heart first and foremost, not the pleadings and mutterings of the capitalist parties."
